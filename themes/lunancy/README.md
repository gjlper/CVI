# Lunacy
A minimal Hugo theme.

###About

This theme is my first try on anything Hugo. It is a theme purposed mainly for a blog; you might want to fork it if you need anything more complex. The demo uses a gif on the sidebar, hence the so-so quality. You can try and fiddle with video or static images if you prefer.

Check out the demo [here](http://christat.me/Lunacy).

### Wishlist

For the following release (if any), I'd like to address the following:
- Remove the clutter (duplicate heading for mobile and web versions, bootstrap doesn't want to help :( )
- Tidy up the css mess

### Contact

Feel free to hit me up, send a pull request or open an Issue (or just rant about how shitty the release is, It's okay).

Thanks for stopping by!
