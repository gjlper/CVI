#### Hello, World!

The first release of Lunacy is here! Over the course of several weeks, I've given Hugo a shot again and finally decided to build what I once intended: a personal blog + theme.

This release is a tiny one, and I'm really not very fond of the organisation behind (just take a look at that css stylesheet and you'll know what I mean). However, since I don't really have the time to clean and tidy everything up for the moment, It'll have to do as is.

### Wishlist

For the following release (if any), I'd like to address the following:

- Remove the clutter/duplicate heading for mobile and web versions: No one wants to maintain duplicate stuff, right? I just have to figure out how to make the styles work properly to avoid glitches.
- Tidy up the css: No small feat, honestly. I'm not proud of that clusterf*ck.
- General cleanup: I'm unsure, but I think all these bootstrap add-ons are not even necessary, and providing just the required ones would be a better solution I guess.

### Contact

Feel free to hit me up over Github, send a pull request or open an Issue (or just rant about how shitty the release is, It's okay).

Thanks for stopping by!
